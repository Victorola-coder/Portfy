        I have the ideal tools for developing JavaScript applications, and I can
        definitely work without them to produce quick, durable solutions that
        are designed for growth â€“ performance and scalability are top objectives
        on my radar.

        I design, even though I{"'"}m probably not the typical designer sitting
        in front of an Illustrator art-board tweaking pixels. You can always
        find me buried in stylesheets, fiddling with font sizes and thinking
        about layouts (~_^). Creating fluid user experiences is something I{"'"}
        m committed to doing while looking chic.
